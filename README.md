# myclawkit ⚡

**Starter kit for OpenClaw — skills, agent identity, and initial config in one shot.**

## What's included

- **25 ready-to-use skills** — research, debugging, writing, brainstorming, business analysis, and more
- **Agent identity** (SOUL.md + AGENTS.md) — personality, principles, and working rules your agent loads on every session
- **Config template** — a sensible `openclaw.json` base that avoids the blank-page problem

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stepanpointer/myclawkit.git
cd myclawkit
./install.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check that OpenClaw and Git are present
2. Create `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` if it doesn't exist yet
3. Copy SOUL.md and AGENTS.md to your agent workspace
4. Install skills to `~/.openclaw/skills/`

Existing configs and skills are never overwritten.

## Config

The script creates `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with sensible defaults.
Edit it to add channel tokens, adjust security policies, or switch models.

## Agent identity

Four files define who the agent is and who it's working for:

- **SOUL.md** — values, personality, how it communicates
- **AGENTS.md** — working rules: memory, security, skill routing
- **IDENTITY.md** — agent name, owner, timezone _(fill this in first)_
- **USER.md** — your profile: background, priorities, preferences _(fill this in first)_

All four are installed to `~/myclawkit-workspace/`. Edit them to personalize the agent.
OpenClaw loads them from the workspace path configured in `openclaw.json`.

A `BOOTSTRAP.md` first-run guide is also included — the agent reads it on first session and deletes it after.

## After installation

```bash
# Start OpenClaw
openclaw start

# Verify everything is healthy
openclaw doctor

# Check available skills
openclaw skills list
```
